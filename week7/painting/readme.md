# Painting cv-example

I used the painting example, and made these changes to the code:

1. Canvas size is bigger.
2. Particles change size randomly from 1 to 100.
3. I changed the background color from "51," to "255", but didn't noticed a difference.
4. I changed the "vScale" vairable to a higher number, which made the bubbles bigger on screen.
