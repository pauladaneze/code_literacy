# Brightness Mirror cv-example

I used the brightness mirror example, and made these changes to the code:

1. I changed the "vScale" variable to a smaller number, which made the pixels' squares smaller.
2. Canvas size is bigger.
3. I changed the background and fill colors.
4. I changed the stroke of the squares from 0 to 2.
